# Angular

- Front-end and Back-end of a web application

## The Concept of Web Stacks

- Stack is not a technical term
  - It is a loose term and can be very fluid and sometimes even subjective
- Angular is a TypeScript based

## Front-End vs. Back-End

- The fridge room could be seen as the **DATABASE** or a series of data resources
- The kitchen is the **WEB APPLICATION SERVER**
- The dinning room is a bundle of tech that contains primarily **HTML, FRONT-END, JAVASCRIPT, CSS**, and image
- The databases and the web application server are part of the **back-end**. HTML, CSS, and front-end JavaScript are a part of the **front-end**.



- The back-end’s primary responsibility is the processing of data, where the front-end’s main responsibility is the displaying of data and handling user interaction. Front-ends process data as well, but heavy data manipulation is generally within the domain of the back-end.

### The Front-End

- In web development, the **front-end** is what the user sees.

### The Back-End

- Both the **web application server** and the **database** live.
  - via TS
    - Handle requests from the front-end for information
    - Create, Read, Update and Delete in the system (**CRUD**)
    - Send info back to the front-end in JSON format (**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation)

## TypeScript

- TypeScript has some features like static variable typing and interfaces that are present in well-respected legacy languages like Java and C#
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which means *transpiled* into JavaScript
- TypeScript is Translated into JavaScript
